## Pokemon!

Hello and welcome to this amazing game!

### Game Rules

* This is a very simple game in which the objective is to "capture" all 12 Pokemon.

* The twist is that each Pokemon is unique and can only be captured one time.

* Clicking on the Pokemon captures it and adds 1 to your current score.

* You can keep track of your current score as well as your sessions High Score at the top of the page.

### Game Functionality

* When the user clicks on a Pokemon that Pokemon is filtered out of its array to prevent the user from scoring again by clicking on it more than once. The user than gains a point for their score.

* The array is then randomized with a temporary array to redraw each Pokemon in a random spot.

* If the users topscore is less than the users current score the topscore is set to match the current score.
